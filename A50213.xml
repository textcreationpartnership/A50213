            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe Subject of this following Discourse, now offering it self to thy Perusal is one of the many <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> which it hath pleased the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Lord of Heaven and of Earth, to treat of and insist upon, in Drawing up and Publishing to the World the great and glorious volume of his Works: in the Margent whereof they have been frequently placed as Red Letters, Asterisms, or pointing Hands, to awaken unto a more heedful attention and serious consideration, the dead heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed sleeping and secure World of Mankind. To promote this, the best and most blessed end and use, of such tremendous and threatning Aspects of the highest and most Dreadful Majesty, is the pious design of the Reverend and Learned Author, in compiling &amp; publishing this Treatise, &amp; its a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand pities it should not be attended to and attained by a People so circumstanced as we, English trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted into, or procreated in these <hi>American De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarts,</hi> be. The labour and pains it hath cost the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor to peruse and consult so many Writers, ancient &amp; modern, <hi>Astronomers, Chronologers,</hi> &amp; <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:44382:3"/> is such as will render it very disingenious, not to give it a grateful and friendly reception and entertainment. He hath therein presented thee with, <hi>first,</hi> the <hi>Theory; secondly,</hi> the <hi>History</hi> of <hi>Comets,</hi> commonly called <hi>Blazing Stars.</hi> As to the <hi>Theory,</hi> there is (to my understanding) as much declared, as it hath pleased the Father of Lights and Fountain of all knowledge &amp; wisdome (hitherto) to discover to poor ignorant Mortals; <hi>viz.</hi> the result of the judicious thoughts of the ablest and best accomplished <hi>Artists,</hi> who upon very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny accurate, unquestionably true and exact Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations, made by the help of choicest Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments improved by minds intensely set to search into, and find out the Mystery and Meaning of those abstruse and admirable works of him who is most High; have declared what they conceive most rationally probable. The wisest of Men know that they understand but little part of Gods wayes and works; and are not ashamed to confess that in things so much above humane Capacity, they are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Quaerists</hi> then <hi>Adeptists,</hi> content to be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of what he is pleased as yet not to discover; our <hi>Authors</hi> modest expressing himself, sheweth he wrote under the influence of so humbling a conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:44382:3"/>
            <p>Of the second, or <hi>Historical</hi> part of the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, the scope is, to evidence and evince that <hi>Comets</hi> are ordinarily the forerunners of disaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Calamities, Mischiefs, &amp; Miseries, hastning to follow and fall down on the heads of senseless &amp; secure Sinners. For the clearing up and making out of which, by way of induction, a great multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of particular Instances and Examples are out of sundry <hi>Authors</hi> of approved ability and faithfulness alledged; who have left upon Record their accurate observations of time, place, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther circumstances of several <hi>Come<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s</hi> in divers ages, with the dreadful Revolutions, dismal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions and Confusions which followed them at the heels. If it be said, that some of those <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wigged Heraulds</hi> have appeared on the <hi>aethereal stage</hi> upon a more benign account: it may be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally replied, that the number of such is very small: and that their <hi>blasting influences,</hi> might be direfully operative in remoter and less known parts of the Earth. When the hand of Heaven is seen writing <hi>MENE MENE TEKEL,</hi> &amp;c. it may become the highest of Mortals to tremble. <hi>Reader,</hi> if thou art one any whit considerably rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed above the level of the lowest sort of men, thou wilt not think it lost labour to acquaint thy self
<pb facs="tcp:44382:4"/> with what is here presented: an awakening and humbling is the best use thou canst make of it; to see it improved unto the furthering thy souls best good will be the most acceptable recompense of the Pious <hi>Authors</hi> unwearied pains: That he may see the desired travel of his soul, shall be the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned wish, of him who is,</p>

            <p>SOme Worthy Persons having desired me to Write the History of Comets; I resolved (with Divine Permission and Assistance) to spend the spare hours of a few Weeks in an endeavour that way. And accordingly I have pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rused what Books I could meet with, which might be helpful to me in this undertaking. There is a late Author <note n="a" place="margin">Stanislai, de <hi>Lubienietz See the Philosophic. Transactions for</hi> An. 1668. vol. 3. p 691., 1071,</note> who on occasion of the Comets seen <hi>Annis</hi> 1664, 65 hath published a large Volume, which he calls <hi>Theatrum Cometicum,</hi> wherein he giveth an account of all the Comets which have been obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved since <hi>Noah's</hi> flood being in number 415, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Events, whether Prosperous or Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse. Also <hi>Erasmus Bartholinus</hi> hath written upon those Comets, which Books, I have very much wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for a sight of, as supposing I should meet with Passages therein, that would be serviceable to me in my present design: But I could not at this distance from <hi>Europe,</hi> suddenly obtain them.</p>
            <p>As for what concerns the <hi>Time,</hi> and other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
<pb facs="tcp:44382:5"/> relating to these <hi>Phaenomenas;</hi> I have been chiefly beholding to the Collections of <hi>Alste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius, Long<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

As for Events which have hapned in these late times, it is needless to quote any Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, for that which our own eyes have seen, or ears heard. I know (as the great <hi>Orator</hi> could say) I am not born for my self, but for others. I may hope that my labour herein, will not be al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

My chief design, is to inform and edifie the ordinary sort of <hi>Readers.</hi> Yet considering that God hath made me a debter to the wise as well as to the weak, I have added some things of the <hi>nature, place; motion of Comets,</hi> which only such as have some skill in <hi>Astronomy</hi> can understand; and unto such, hints of that kind will

These late years having been attended with several <hi>Comets,</hi> and there being some who would have the World believe, there is no cause of dread when such <hi>Ensigns</hi> amidst the Heavenly Host, are held up in the sight of all the Earth; I hope the publishing a discourse on the present Subject, will not be judged unseasonable.

                     <p>THe Sentiments of learned Men, concerning the place where and the matter out of which <hi>Comets</hi> are made; have been very various. The <hi>Peripa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tetick School</hi> has phansied them to be <hi>Meteors,</hi> generated out of the Bowels of the Earth, exhaled and extolled by the Sun to the supream Region of the Air, and there set on Fire. It would be needless and endless to tell how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny have after <hi>Aristotle</hi> embraced this fiction, but it may not be unprofitable in a few words to evince the contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Comets</hi> are not placed in the <hi>first</hi> heaven or Air, but farr above
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:44382:8"/> it, in the <hi>second</hi> or <hi>Starry Heaven,</hi> and that therefore they are rather <hi>Stars</hi> than <hi>Meteors.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. That most learned Mathematici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an <hi>Hevelius</hi> his argument from the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Comets</hi> is irrefragable <note n="a" place="margin">In Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tographiae Lib. 2. Pag. 132.</note> whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver body (saith he) is moved in the great Circle, dividing the Sphaere, and keeping fixed Poles, is certainly Ethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial and not Aereal. But this is true of every <hi>Comet;</hi> its diurnal or common mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is absolved as other Caelestial bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are, which cannot be said of any sort of <hi>Meteors;</hi> yea, the motion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is exact and regular, though at first its more swift, and afterwards more slow, yet in that inequality, there is an exact proportion and regularity obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, when as it is otherwise with <hi>Meteors</hi> that are tossed to and fro, and move not through the great Circle. The motion of <hi>Comets</hi> doth very much imitate not that of the <hi>fixed Stars,</hi> but of the <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets,</hi> whence they are by some called <hi>Pseudo-Planetae,</hi> and by others. <hi>Spuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous-Planets.</hi> And the Holy Scripture seems to give that name of <hi>Planets</hi> to them, or as our Translation hath it <hi>wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring Stars, Jude,</hi> 13. <gap reason="foreign">

                        <hi>Kepler</hi> observed the Blazing Star which was seen <hi>A. D.</hi> 1618. to be at its first appearance three times as high as the Moon. <hi>Hevelius</hi>

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:44382:9"/> just as Fishes die when listed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the water; But supposing it to be 80 miles distant from the Earth, and the <hi>Comet</hi> to be there, it would not have been above the Horizon, more then two hours; when as it was so 17 hours. And at the very hour when <note n="d" place="margin">Idem in Lib. 3. P. 151, 155.</note>
                        <hi>Hevelius</hi> did at <hi>Dantzick</hi> observe it to be in the Star near the foot of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius, Bullialdus</hi> in <hi>Paris</hi> saw it in the very same place, whenas, if it had been no higher then the supream Region of the air, it would have appeared to <hi>Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lialdus</hi> (being then in <hi>Paris</hi>) in <hi>Hercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi> and not in <hi>Persius,</hi> as it did to those in <hi>Dantzick</hi> Nor would a Blazing Star be observed by all the World at once (where the Stars under which it moves, are seen) if it were not above the air. The opinion of <hi>Panaetius,</hi> who thought that a <hi>Comet</hi> was a meer <hi>Emphasis</hi> or <hi>Parelion,</hi> proceeding from the refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of some other Star, is solidly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed, from this consideration, that a <hi>Parelion</hi> is not seen in all Countries at once; The same argument proveth that <hi>Comets</hi> have their existence above the air.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. We may argue from the magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of <hi>Comets,</hi> that they are as high as the starry Heaven. <hi>Snellius</hi>

D.</hi> 1577. how then is it possible for the air to contain so vast a body? <hi>Majus non potest contineri a minori.</hi> And <hi>Gotfridus Wenoelinus</hi> observed that the magnitude of the <hi>Comet</hi> which appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>A.

P. 439.</note> That a Comet is either 1, <hi>Crinite,</hi> h. c. when the Beams or Blaze is all round the body of the Star; under which cometh that sort of Comet which is called <hi>Disceus,</hi> appearing in form like a Dish. <hi>Pithites,</hi> when the Comet is like a Tub or Hogshead, <hi>Hippeus,</hi> when it resembles an Horses main. <hi>Hircus;</hi> when the Blaze is like to Goats hair. Or 2. <hi>Barbate,</hi> h. c. when the Blaze is on the one side of the Comet only.

As for the true cause of the <hi>Blaze,</hi> it seems evident that it doth proceed from the <hi>Sun beams,</hi> passing through the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Star. For the <hi>Coma</hi> or <hi>Blaze</hi> is not on that side of the Star which is
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:44382:14"/> next to the Sun, but which is opposite there from. Some antient Writers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan a little to take notice of this. But <hi>Appianus</hi> was the first that did fully and clearly discern it to be so, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the truth of this notion, by five several Comets which himself lived to see, <hi>viz.</hi> Those in <hi>Anno.</hi> 1531, 32, 33, 38, 39. Likewise <hi>Gemma,</hi> and <hi>Cornelius Frisius, Fracastorius, Tycho,</hi> and of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter times <hi>Gassendus,</hi> and many other fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Mathematicians, and diligent ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servers of things of this nature whom the learned <hi>Reader</hi> may see quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <note n="s" place="margin">L. 8.

                        <hi>Longomontanus</hi> observeth, that if the Comet have a more lateral disposition towards the Sun, then it will be <hi>Cauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> but if the opposition to the Sun be more direct, or the Comet elevated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Sun, then it will be <hi>Crinite,</hi> or the Blaze but short. The blaze is long or short according to the opposition to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Sun, and distance from the Earth. The blaze of some Comets hath extended it self above ninety De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees. There was one in <hi>Aristotle's</hi> time that was an 130 Degrees in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude. If the Comet be higher then the Sun, the blaze will be short. If the Comet be as low as the Sun, then
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:44382:15"/> the nearer it is to the Sun, the longer will the blaze appear to be. By the things that have been thus far discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, we may conclude that the time of any Comets appearance cannot certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be praedicted before hand. Some very learned men, (in special the great and noble <note n="u" place="margin">
                           <hi>Dc. augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis scientiarum</hi> P. 242.</note>
                        <hi>Verulam</hi>) have suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed that this knowledge is attainable. Indeed, if Comets were sempiternal bodies, by experience and observation their appearance might be exactly prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted. But since they are generated in the <hi>Aether,</hi> no man can any more tell when they shall be seen, then he can know when a <hi>Paraelion,</hi> or <hi>Draco volans</hi> or the like will be generated in the Air. Yet I will not deny, but that a <hi>probable conjecture,</hi> as to the year of a Comets appearance, may be made from the conjunction of the superiour Planets. It hath been <note n="w" place="margin">Franciscus Junctinus <hi>in Annotationibus de Cometis</hi> Cornelius Gemma <hi>Cos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogr.</hi> L. 1 C. 18</note> observed that those rare Conjunctions are commonly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with the appearance of some <hi>new Star,</hi> or <hi>Comet:</hi> So indeed it was as to ths <hi>Blazing Stars</hi> in 1504, 1506, 1525, 1577, 1583, 1664. notable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions of the Planets did praecede them. Upon this ground, <note n="x" place="margin">Edlin <hi>in his praenuncius sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereus</hi> Pag. 36 37, 89.</note> a late <hi>Astrologer,</hi> publishing a Treatise of the conjunction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi>
                        <pb n="17" facs="tcp:44382:15"/> Anno. 1663. conjectured that a Comet would appear the next year: which hapned to be true; and if an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strologer</hi> (as the blind man hits the mark) chance to praedict right once, more notice is taken of that, then of his mistaking an hundred times over. Very notable Conjunctions of the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets hapned this present, and will do so again the next year, (as shall be more particularly mentioned) If any man should now positively affirm, that within this twelve moneth another <hi>Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing Star</hi> will appear, it would be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous, although it is both possible and probable that it may so come to pass. But the observation doth not alwayes hold good; For there have been both greater and lesser Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the Planets, when no Comet hath appeared, and many Comets with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any such Conjunctions immediately praeceding. In few words, sometimes, many <hi>Blazing Stars</hi> have been seen within the compass of a few years; there have been at least ten within these eighty years last past. But in some a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, not one Comet hath appeared for an hundred years together. Since se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral may appear (in two, nay) in one year, and it may be not one in fifty nor
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:44382:16"/> in an hundred years, the appearance of such <hi>Phaenomena's,</hi> cannot be infallibly foreseen by any humane understanding upon Earth.</p>
                     <p>There are who think, that inasmuch as Comets may be supposed to proceed from natural causes, there is no <hi>speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing voice of Heaven</hi> in them, beyond what is to be said of all other works of God. But certain it is, that many things which may happen according to the course of nature, are portentous signs of divine anger, and prognosticks of great evils hastening upon the world A Learned and Judicious Author <note n="y" place="margin">Hevelius <hi>in Cometogr.

The like is to be said of nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Eclipses of the Luminaries in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. I confess I have not so great an Opinion of the omniousness of <hi>Eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> as I perceive some Learned and Good Men have, since every Year, there is an Eclipse taken notice of in one part of the Earth or other. Nevertheless, whoso reads <hi>Calvisius</hi> and other Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nologers, will perhaps think that such a notion is not wholly to be slighted. Chronologers observe that in the very Year when the ten Tribes were carried into Captivity, there hapned a great Eclipse of the Sun, which came not to pass without a special hand of divine providence; unto this the Prophet seemeth to allude, <hi>Amos</hi> 8. 9. That <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipse</hi> was omninous of a <hi>Dark Day</hi> coming upon <hi>Samaria.</hi> Many notable Instances might be produced to this purpose. And something hath been observed among our selves, which seems to confirm their Opinion, who believe that <hi>total</hi> and <hi>central Eclipses,</hi> are ominous of mutations where they happen. There was such an <hi>Eclipse</hi>
                        <pb n="21" facs="tcp:44382:17"/> of the Sun in <hi>New England</hi> (Aug. 12. A.

Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the World. He that rideth upon the Heavens, and in his Excellency on the skie, when he decreed that such events should come to pass; did also deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine that such things should go before.

The Empire was put into a strange hurly burly. For the Emperour had no less then seven Armies to defend himself. The Pope and He were at daggers drawing; the

The Pope immediately died with grief and vexation. Another remarkable thing was, that a great Mountain in <hi>Burgundy</hi> was by an Earth quake removed, whereby five thousands of Country People, living in the Villages were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed, and killed in a moment.</p>

The Emperour and the Pope being at variance, the Emperour died suddenly, not without suspition of Poyson by the Popes procurement. The Pope himself died within a year. The new Pope made a great disturbance in <hi>Italy,</hi> but his Army was shamefully overcome.

At first it could be seen only in the morning, at last only in the evening, in the middle of its duration it might be seen all the night long. Its motion (which was alwayes retrograde) at its beginning and ending was slow, but in the midst of its circuit was swift, even so as to dispatch 40 degrees in one na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural day. It passed from <hi>Virgo</hi> through <hi>Bootes,</hi> the <hi>Dragon, Ʋrsa minor,</hi> the feet of <hi>Cepheus,</hi> breast of <hi>Cassiopea, Andromeda, Pisces, Serpenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> until it came to the <hi>Whale,</hi> where by reason of <hi>Occasus Heliacus,</hi> it disappeared.

The King of <hi>Denmark</hi> died. Insurrections in many places in <hi>Germany</hi> followed. The next year the Popes <hi>Legate</hi> made a Proclamation in <hi>Hungaria,</hi> that whatsoever would go out against the <hi>Turks</hi> should have <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences</hi> granted them, whereupon a great rabble gathered together, but instead of warring against the <hi>Turks,</hi> they fell upon their own Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men

                     <p>A. D. 1527. On the eleventh day of <hi>August,</hi> a most terrifying <note n="f" place="margin">VVolfius, Cent. 16. P. 293. Lavater, Herlicius, Gem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma.</note> Comet was seen, of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mense longitude, and bloody colour. The form of it, was like a mans arm holding an huge Sword in his hand with which he was ready to strike. Such terrour and horrour surprized the Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of this Prodigy, as that some died away with dread &amp; amazement. <note n="g" place="margin">Ricciolus.</note> The next year another Comet was seen in <hi>Pisces, Jan.</hi> 18.

And that woful Disease known by the name of <hi>the English Sweat,</hi> infected all places of the Realm, whereby whole miriads were sent to the Grave.

                        </note> Comet was observed. And again the next year in <hi>August</hi> and <hi>September,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving its motion from the beginning of <hi>Leo</hi> unto <hi>Libra,</hi> appearing first in the Morning before Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:44382:55"/> afterwards in the evening. Again, <note n="i" place="margin">Appianus. <hi>Confessio</hi> Augustana.</note> the year following from <hi>September</hi> 26. to <hi>October</hi> 20. its motion being from <hi>Virgo</hi> to <hi>Scorpio,</hi> and at first a southern, but at last a northern Latitude. The body of the Star was three times as big as the Planet <hi>Jupiter;</hi> the stream exceeding long, point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the South-west. The next year in <hi>June,</hi> in <hi>Gemini;</hi> the Star somewhat greater then <hi>Jupiter,</hi> the figure like a long sword. As for the more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Events, attending those Blazing Stars, thus annually appearing, they were such as these. An Earth-quake in <hi>Portugal;</hi> above a thousand houses were thrown down thereby. A sore Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine in some Countries. A great Flood or Inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Waters in the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> viz. in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Friezland,</hi> and <hi>Zeland</hi> (no Iess then four hundred and four Parishes were drowned;) yea and in <hi>Poland:</hi> Also at <hi>Rome</hi> the River <hi>Tyber</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verflowed its Banks. Now did the famous <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession</hi> of <hi>Ausburg</hi> come forth, and the name of <hi>Protestant</hi> was first known. That Confession was put into the form of a Covenant, subscribed by several of the Electoral Princes, who <hi>protested</hi> they would abide by the Truth, so did the <hi>opposers</hi> of Popery come to bear the name of <hi>Protestants.</hi> The World blazed and flamed out with Wars every where. In the East the <hi>Persians</hi> and <hi>Turks</hi> were at variance. Also the <hi>Turks</hi> made
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:44382:56"/> an irruption upon <hi>Christendome. Hungaria</hi> was full of Troubles. In <hi>Helnetia</hi> there was an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy War, wherein <hi>Zuinglius</hi> (that Star of the first magnitude) lost his life. In <hi>Westphalia,</hi> the <hi>Munsterian Anabaptists</hi> brought all to confusion. In <hi>Denmark,</hi> the <hi>Popish</hi> party designing to suppress the Protestants, involved that Kingdome in War and Blood. In <hi>Africa,</hi> the Kingdome of <hi>Tunis</hi> was put into a flame by <hi>Barbarossa.</hi> Great mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations hapned in <hi>England</hi> which filled the World with discourse and wonderment, for King <hi>Henry VIII.</hi> cast off the Popes Supremacy, and turned the <hi>Monks</hi> and <hi>Friers</hi> out of doors, disposing of the Church-lands to whom he pleased. By all which things it appears, that the Blazing Stars mentioned were not seen for nothing.</p>

A ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Conflagration hapned in <hi>Constantinople</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:44382:56"/> several dayes. A fiery Summer and a scorching Drought in many places. The King of <hi>France</hi> came with an Army into <hi>Italy.</hi> The King of <hi>Spains</hi> Navy was overcome by <hi>Barbarossa.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi> died with grief, and his death oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned great mutations and miseries in that part of <hi>Germany.</hi> The <hi>Antinomians</hi> headed by an obscure and illiterate person (one <hi>John Isleb</hi>) did now first begin to <hi>Blaze</hi> in <hi>Germany.</hi> A principal City in the Countrey of <hi>Mexico</hi> was almost over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed by a Deluge of boyling water which descended from a <hi>Vulcano</hi> near unto it.</p>

Three years after that another appeared of a bloody colour. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Events, were, a great Drought, in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> the lesser Rivers were clean dried up, much Cattle died there for lack of Water. In <hi>Silisia</hi> and other Countries the Locusts did much harm. The designed Expedition of the <hi>Christians</hi> against the <hi>Turks</hi> proved unhappy, a great part of the <hi>Christian</hi> Army dying by an Epidemical Disease. The latter of these Comets was attended with the first Session of the Council of <hi>Trent;</hi> Also at the Popes Instigation the <hi>Waldenses</hi> were destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for their Religion, and Popish, Barbarous, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paralled Cruelties exercised towards them, The

In the midst of its appearance the motion was most swift, for it dispatched 15 Degrees every day. At the first it was retrograde, but afterwards direct. In the space of four dayes it was removed about 70 Degrees Westward, and 30 Degrees North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. It moved towards the Planet <hi>Saturn,</hi> the nearer it came to him, the slower was its motion. <note n="n" place="margin">Gemma.</note> Its magnitude at its disappearing in a manner equal to what it was at first. This Comet was attended with the death of many Learned and Worthy Men; and with the fiery part of Queen <hi>Mary's</hi> Persecution.

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:44382:57"/> Monastery. Such an Inundation hapned at <hi>Rome</hi> by the River <hi>Tybers</hi> overflowing, as that a great part of the City was thereby destroyed.</p>
                     <p>A. D. 1558. A Comet was seen in the Evening under <hi>Coma Berenices,</hi> of a pale colour, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about 30 dayes. <note n="o" place="margin">Thuanus, Lib. 21. Page 577. Tycho <hi>Epist</hi> P. 144.</note> Also in <hi>May</hi> the next year; and in <hi>December</hi> the year after that. These three years did not pass without such things as were very observable. In <hi>England</hi> there was such a prodigious Tempest as the like (in respect of circumstances) is seldome mentioned in any History. That year also Queen <hi>Mary</hi> died, and famous Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> seconded, whereby af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs both in Church and State were strangely al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered. The Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> V. said that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met was sent to give him notice of his approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Death. And at the sight of it, made this Pentameter, <hi>His ergò indicijs me mea fata vocant.</hi> So it hapned, for he died that year, <note n="p" place="margin">Ricciolus.</note> The next year the Pope died, and no less then fifteen Cardinals, also the King of <hi>France,</hi> the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> and many other Princes.</p>
                     <p>A. D. 1577. This year a notable blazing Star amazed the VVorld for three Moneths together. Those famous Mathematicians <hi>Michael Mastlin, Cornelius Gemma,</hi> and <hi>Tycho Brahe,</hi> have written
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:44382:58"/> largely and learnedly concerning that Comet. It was seen first on the ninth of <hi>November,</hi> in the beginning of <hi>Capricorn,</hi> passing through that sign and <hi>Aquarius,</hi> to the midst of <hi>Pisces.</hi> The Star was equal to <hi>Venus</hi> in magnitude, being a compact solid body, and like a little Moon, shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning as the purest Silver. The stream differed in colour from the Star, for it was red and fiery, in breadth five Degrees, and in length thirty. To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the body of the Star, the rayes were more condensed, but the longer they were distended they appeared to be more scattered and diffused abroad, which argued that the Stream was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created by some external light penetrating through the body of the Star; and it was obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be opposite to the Sun, yet so as that the form of it was bending like a Bow, whose con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vexity was towards the Zenith, and concavity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Horizon.</hi> Both <hi>Gemma</hi> and <hi>Tycho</hi> found that this Comet was higher then the Moon. According to <hi>Tycho's</hi> observation, the true Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter of the Star was 368. <hi>Mill. Germ.</hi> so that its proportion to the Earth was as 3 to 14. The Longitude of the Comets tail he found to be 96 Semidiameters of the Earth. He concluded it was not in the Airy but in the <hi>Etherial</hi> VVorld, because it did admit of no sensible Parallax.

The first appeared from <hi>August</hi> 25. to <hi>September</hi> 25. about three hours af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter midnight, casting its blaze from the East to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the West. <hi>September 1.

<pb n="109" facs="tcp:44382:61"/> who were accurate and diligent observers of this Prodigy, then that which is related by those still alive, that in their youth might see it. There had not the like Comet to this appeared for the space of 150 years.</p>
                     <p>It was seen first in <hi>Libra,</hi> moving towards the North with some inclination Westward, <hi>viz.</hi> through the midst of <hi>Libra</hi> and <hi>Bootes,</hi> when it came there it might be seen all the night long, The body of the Comet was to appearance big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then a Star of the first magnitude, and would sometimes seem to twinkle. <hi>Wendeline, Cusatus</hi> and others that viewed it with a <hi>Telescope,</hi> did to their admiration observe a little Nut or Star in the body of this Comet; after that it was broken into three Stars like Coals of fire in a flaming Oven; after that into a multitude of little Stars which could not be numbred because they would sometimes sparkle out, and otherwhile abscond from the eye. The blaze was narrow near the Star, but broad at a distance from it. At its first appearance it bended like a Bow, but afterwards it appeared straight. The Colour of the Blaze near the Star was red and fiery, but towards the end of it white and pale, very much refembling the <hi>Via Lactea. December</hi> 21. the visible Longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the blaze was 22 Degrees, <hi>December</hi> 8. it was 58 Degrees, <hi>Decemb.</hi> 9. it was 75. Degrees in length. <hi>Longomontanus</hi> saith that once the Blaze was extended one hundred &amp; four degrees
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:44382:62"/> in length; and that as for its distance from the Earth it was four times as high as the Moon <hi>viz.</hi> 240 <hi>S. T.</hi> Before it was extinct it had a less <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallax</hi> then the Sun, and therefore was above it. The true length of the blaze was beyond that of its distance from the Earth no less then 445 <hi>S. T.</hi> so that a man going forty miles every day would not in an hundred years go so far as that blaze ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. He might sooner go round the whole Earth seventy times over, then once go over the extent of that formidable blaze. Remarkable Events, attending these Comets, were, the death of the Emperour and Empress. A drought all that Winter; An Earth quake (which hapned on the day when the first of these Comets appeared) in <hi>Italy</hi> removed a Mountain which fell upon the Town of <hi>Plours,</hi> whereby an 1500 persons were crushed to death in a moment. But the great and fatal consequent of this Prodigy, was, the <hi>Bohemic</hi> and <hi>Germanic</hi> War, in which Rivers of Blood were poured forth. No less then six (some say eight) hundred thousand lives being cut off by the devouring mouth of the Swora. And the Prince <hi>Palatine,</hi> King of <hi>Bohemia</hi> dispos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed of his haereditary Estate, forced to fly for his life, and his Countrey made a desolation. Quickly after these Blazing Stars, God sent the Plague amongst the <hi>Indians</hi> here in <hi>New-England</hi> which sweptthem away in such numbers, as that the living were not enough to bury the dead.

In the beginning of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary,</hi> that thick and lucid Clot began to attenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, and break away, whence the head of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met was diminished, that <hi>January</hi> 6. it seemed to contain but 8 <hi>Minutes, January</hi> 22. The form of the Comet was not exactly round, but seemed to be rough and broken, and in some places point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out more then in other places. As for the true magnitude of the Comet, it was at first about six times as big as the Earth, after it was diminish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>January,</hi> it was again augmented in <hi>Februa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi> It did not alwayes keep the same distance from the Earth. The <hi>Parallax</hi> was 59. <hi>sec.</hi> In the midst of its appearance, when the motion was most swift about 4. <hi>m.</hi> and at last but 16. <hi>sec▪</hi> So that at first it was distant from the Earth 3500. S. T. in the midst 1000. And <hi>February</hi> 4. 1200. S. T. Towards the end of <hi>December</hi> when near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est to the Earth, it was twenty times as far off as the Moon, in the middle of <hi>January</hi> it was as high as the Sun, in the beginning of <hi>February</hi> as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from the Earth, as <hi>Mars</hi> is. The Blaze was 14. Degrees in Longitude, being towards the extremity spread abroad, resembling a <hi>Peacocks tail.</hi> It appeared sometimes longer, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times shorter. <hi>December</hi> 21. it was observed to be 22 Degrees in length, and towards the point of it, to bend a little, the concavity towards the Horizon, but the next day it was straight again
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:44382:65"/>
                        <hi>December</hi> 28. a sudden and great alteration was observed in the Blaze; for it pointed not towards the West, as before it had done, but upwards and towards the North. From <hi>December</hi> 29. it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to incline more Eastward. <hi>January</hi> 5. the Blaze pointed directly towards the East. It was observable that it seemed still to point towards the <hi>Gemini;</hi> so that the Blaze was ever in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to the Sun; and we may therefore conclude that it did proceed from the beams thereof, pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing through the body of the Comet. The Star lost its <hi>Blaze</hi> in the latter end of <hi>January,</hi> and yet recovered it again in part in the beginning of <hi>February.</hi> Its motion was retrograde, from <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vus,</hi> through <hi>Hydra,</hi> the <hi>Ship, Canis major,</hi> the <hi>Hare, Eridanus,</hi> the head of the <hi>Whale</hi> unto <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> so that it passed through six signes in the <hi>Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diack, viz. Libra, Virgo, Leo Cancer, Gemini, Taurus.</hi> Thus far is <hi>Hevelius</hi> his account of this notable Comet. Not long after this another, no less admirable did appear. It was by the but now mentioned learned person first observed, <hi>April</hi> 6. St. <hi>N.</hi> about 1 <hi>h.</hi> A. M, in the breast of <hi>Pega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, viz.</hi> in 14. 21. of <hi>Pisces,</hi> and <hi>Lat. Boreal.</hi> 26. 30. of a clear and radiant aspect. In the midst of the Comets head one might with a <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lescope</hi> discern one <hi>Nucleus</hi> or Star very lucid and shining like Gold, which was encompassed with a more dilute matter. The <hi>Blaze</hi> proceeding therefrom was almost as thick as the matter in
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:44382:65"/> which the <hi>Nucleus</hi> was contained. <hi>April</hi> 8. it appeared very lucid, so that one might perceive the Comet after the other Stars disappeared, the <hi>Nucleus</hi> not much altered from what it was at first <hi>April</hi> 16. the Comet seemed brighter then any of the fixed Stars, yea to outshine <hi>Saturn;</hi> then by the help of the <hi>Telescope</hi> one might discern the <hi>Nucleus</hi> to be more bright and bigger then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. The <hi>Diameter</hi> of the <hi>Nucleus</hi> was less then <hi>Jupiter's,</hi> but equal to <hi>Saturu</hi>'s, whence one might conclude that the Comet was as yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing. The <hi>Nucleus</hi> seemed to cast a notable shadow on that side which was averse to the Sun. For the blaze seemed to be divided, the reason of which might be because the <hi>Nucleus</hi> was so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact and solid, that the beams of the Sun could not pass through it, only through the thin matter which was on both sides of it. The matter on the sore part of the <hi>Nucleus</hi> as the Comet came nearer to the Sun, appeared to be more acumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and diminished. The <hi>Parallax</hi> of this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met was at first 69 <hi>sec.</hi> at last 41. <hi>sec.</hi> The mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude of the <hi>Nucleus</hi> was 12. <hi>sec.</hi> and of the whole head of the Comet 6. <hi>min.</hi> so that when nearest to the Earth, it was sixty times as high as the Moon, and at last as high as the Sun. The blaze was 17. sometimes 25. Degrecs as to its visible Longitude. The motion of this Comet was direct according to the order of the signs, at first appearing in <hi>Pisces,</hi> and at last in <hi>Taurus.</hi> It
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:44382:66"/> continued for the space of fourteen dayes.</p>
                     <p>As for remarkable Events attending these <hi>Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing Stars,</hi> we cannot but remember what doleful things quickly followed.

                     <p>As for Events; many places were this year sorely afflicted with <hi>Earth quakes.</hi> In <hi>Asia,</hi> there was an horrendous <hi>Earth quake</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued for 80 dayes together. The Cities of

                     <p>A. D. 1677. A Comet appeared in the sign <hi>Taurus,</hi> between the Base of the Triangle, and the unformed Stars in the Cloud of <hi>Aries.</hi> The head of it was in a right line with the heart of <hi>Cassiopeja</hi> and the <hi>Alamak.</hi>

                     <p>As for Events following this Comet; within a year a Town in <hi>Piedmont</hi> called <hi>Bosia</hi> suddenly sunk down into the Earth, so as that nothing of it appeared, only two persons in the whole Town that escaped with their lives. But I find that some late Writers in <hi>England,</hi> think that this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met was an <hi>Omen</hi> of the late Horrid Popish Plot, wherein it was resolved that the Protestant Name should no more be had in remembrance, which hellish design was ripe for Execution, had not He which sits in the Heavens prevented. It was before observed, that <hi>Hamans</hi> bloody Conspiracy to cut off the Lords People, was attended with a Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing Star. And why might not this Combination of the <hi>Antichristian</hi> party (which was worse then that of <hi>Hamans</hi>) be so too? Now as the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of <hi>Haman</hi> (who was a Type of <hi>Anti-Christ</hi>) his wicked contrivance, ended in the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter destruction of himself, and of his Children; So the Lord grant that the revealing of this Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Plot may issue in the ruine of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> and of those that do uphold him; and let every Man that fears God, or that bears any love to his Name and Truth, say, <hi>Amen!</hi>

Its <hi>Blaze</hi> appeared very red and fiery, extending as far as the breast of the <hi>Swan. Dec.</hi> 14. its head was first discerned, the Blaze passing to the North-ward of <hi>Cor Aquilae. Dec.</hi> 16. its appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance was very terrible▪ the Blaze ascended above 60 Degrees almost to its <hi>Zenith,</hi> growing conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually broader from the head, and was brightest on both ends, especially on the South side, the middle considerably darker then either of the sides. <hi>Jan.</hi> 8.

For if it had not been much higher then the Moon, its true motion would have far exceeded its visible. About the middle of <hi>February,</hi> it vanished out of our sight.</p>
                     <p>As for Remarkable Events, attending this Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing Star, We that live in <hi>America</hi> know but little of the great Motions in <hi>Europe,</hi> much less in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica</hi> and <hi>Asia,</hi> until a long time afterwards. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we are informed of some considerable Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions the last year, between the <hi>Tartars</hi> and the <hi>Chineses.</hi> Likewise in <hi>Hungaria,</hi> some things worthy of Remark have hapned. Above four hundred Villages in that Countrey have lately been laid desolate by Sword and Fire. The <hi>Turks</hi> have an Army on foot there, and it is strange to consider (only God maketh the Earth to help the Woman) that those Barbarous Infidels, should declare unto the Emperour of <hi>Germany,</hi> that they will not be at peace with him, except he do's restore unto the oppressed <hi>Protestants</hi> their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and estates which have been unjustly taken
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:44382:69"/> from them. The Pope has disposed of the Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical <hi>10th.</hi> in the State <hi>Millan</hi> to be imployed in a war against the <hi>Hungarian</hi> Protestants. This last Summer the Protestants (commonly called <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels</hi>) in those parts have had Wonderful succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses against the Popish Generation. It is possible this may be a <hi>beginning of Revenges upon the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</hi> The great expectation, is, that the next year the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> will come in person against the Emperour, with the most formidable Army which hath been known in the World for these many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. It may be another (the last and most fatal) blast of the second wo Trumpet, is now about to sound. In the Summer after this <hi>Blazing Star,</hi> there was an afflictive Drought, not only in <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica,</hi> but in <hi>Europe.</hi> The next (<hi>i. e.</hi> the last) win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, there was a great Inundation in the <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands;</hi> many thousands perished in the fatal night when those great Waters came nigh unto them. It is said that those Provinces suffered more by that Inundation, then by all the <hi>French</hi> Wars which of late have been so heavy upon them. The poor Protestants in <hi>France,</hi> are blazing in a flame of Persecution. The <hi>French KING</hi> in his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration newly come forth, boasts that he hath caused several Millions of Protestants to forsake their holy Profession, and to turn <hi>Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks;</hi> He also and the Pope are quarelling who shall be Pope in <hi>France.</hi> Yea his hand seems to be against every one, and every mans against him,

                     <p>A. D. 1682. It is reported that in <hi>Germany</hi> a Blazing Star was seen <hi>June</hi> 17. in the South-west, which continued visible for the space of an hour, and was then obscured by the rising of the Sun. If that Relation be true, there have been two Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets (or one hath twice appeared) this present year. For it is certain that there was one visible in <hi>August</hi> last. Some had a sight of it <hi>August</hi> 15. for my own part, I saw it not until <hi>August</hi> 18. 3. <hi>h.</hi> A. M when it was in the foreclaw of <hi>Ʋrsa major.</hi> The stream about 10.

E.</hi> only in the morning, whenas I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by Letters from <hi>London,</hi> that they saw it in the Evening the same night when we beheld it in the morning only. By reason of its septen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trional Latitude, tis past doubt that in the more Northern Climates it was seen both in the morning and in the evening of the same day, yea all the night long, as hath been noted concerning the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets appearing <hi>Annis 1432, 1470, 1513, 1607.

<pb n="129" facs="tcp:44382:71"/> parallel with the Ecliptick. Thus it passed through <hi>Coma Berenices,</hi> and through the leg of <hi>Bootes▪ August</hi> 31.

No man of wisdome and judgement can relish the boldness of such a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetaster; Especially considering that he does praedict things that are contrary to the Scriptures of Truth.

So that they are preachers of divine wrath, and the consequences of them prove fatal unto some or other, in which respect all ought to walk with an holy fear of the infinite Majesty, who doth whatsoever he pleaseth in Heaven and Earth, in the Sea and in all deep places, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly caufeth such tokens to appear in the Heavens when it seemeth good unto him.

<pb n="133" facs="tcp:44382:73"/> that the true Planets and fixed Stars have a natural influence into such things, though the manner of their operation is by us silly Mortals undeclarable. <hi>Gen. 1. 14. Deut. 33. 13, 14. Judg. 5. 20. Job</hi> 38. 31, 32, 33. And therefore it is not impossible but that <hi>Comets</hi> may have the like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural influence, especially when they are near to the Sun, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d that therefore the Blaze proceeding from them reacheth the Earth, though by us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discernable. The light which the Moon recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth from the Sun hath a physical and wonderful influence upon the Earth, so may the Beams which blaze through a Cometical body have likewise. As to their natural operation, they may have dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent effects, causing Droughts in one place, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undations in another, Earth quakes in another, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> according to the occult qualities which are in the subjects of their influence. And whereas, <hi>Wars, Commotions, Persecutions Heresies, the Death of Princes, Changes,</hi> and <hi>overturnings in the World</hi> do usually happen after the appearance of such Stars, they seem to be <hi>only signal</hi> and not causal of such events. The reasons alledged by some to prove that Comets have a physical influence into such effects are not solid. I should therefore ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conclude, that they are signs of such things to follow only in respect of their <hi>Ʋniversal</hi> and <hi>supernatural cause,</hi> God having ordained them for that end, that so the Inhabitants of the World, when they behold such fearful sights might there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:44382:74"/> be awakened unto repentance. I know some Learned Men do not assent unto this conclusion. <hi>Scaliger</hi> laughs at their conceit who <note n="c" place="bottom">De subtilitate exercit. 79.</note> suppose that Comets threaten Kings and Kingdomes. <hi>Budritius</hi>
                        <note n="d" place="bottom">Referente <hi>Keckermanno</hi> in Syst. Phys. L 6. P. 742.</note> hath published a Tractate, whose design is to prove the contrary. And the truth is, that the Arguments insisted on by the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of <hi>Aristotle</hi> are srivolous; And when they speak of Comets falling upon the Earth, and so infecting the Air, and tell us that sometimes Stones of a Sulphurous nature have fallen down out of them, their phansies are ridiculous. But it doth not follow that a principle is not true, because it hath been weakly maintained by some that have undertaken its Patronage. The weightiest ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection against the inference which we adhere un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, is, That there have been some happy Comets, and that the evils pretended to follow after them, have sometimes hapned when no Comet hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared. <hi>Tacitus</hi> calls that an happy Blazing Star which was seen before <hi>Nero</hi>'s Death, because it signified the do wnfal of one that had a malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant influence upon the whole Earth; Others mention the Comets that were observed before <hi>Wickliff, Huss,</hi> and <hi>Luther</hi> began to publish the Gospel, as happy <hi>Omens</hi> that the light of truth should be dispersed in the World. But truly, the number of instances on this hand, is so small and inconsiderable, that it cannot invalidate their
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:44382:74"/> Assertion, who affirm that <hi>Blazing Stars are most commonly portentous of evil Events.</hi> And if we should say as some do that the appearance of a Comet is like the coming of a New Ruler to the people, <note n="e" place="bottom">V. <hi>Keckerman</hi> in eodem libro P. 732.</note>
                        <hi>Either a great good or a great evil,</hi> there is room left to fear the worst. Moreover, as there are contrary Interests in the World, so that may be happy for one, that will be woful for the other. And although such evil Events as those in the preceding Chapters related, have sometimes hapned without any blazing star imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately forerunning, that doth not prove, that when such signs do appear in heaven, they are not signal of miseries not far off. Wars &amp; commotions have hapned though Armies have not been seen fighting in the Air. Will any man there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore say, that such apparitions are not to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted ominous or significative that evils of that nature are like to ensue?

Some object that after the blaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Star, Anno, 1097. A very fertile prosperous year followed, but they forget that the next year a direful Plague raged in the World. Others object that <hi>Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liffs</hi> and <hi>Luthers</hi> Reformations, had <hi>Comets</hi> to procede them. But (to say nothing of the Warrs and fatal changes which in those dayes hapned in diverse parts of the World) two or three exceptions do not invalidate the truth of a general Assertion. If such signs are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly Presages of sore Calamityes, that's enough to awaken men out of their Lethargyes, though now and then, once in an hundred times it should happen to be otherwayes, which yer remains to be demonstrated. As for their notion who think that <hi>Comets</hi> are signs that
<pb facs="tcp:44382:82"/> the light of the Gospel shall be further dispersed in the world, or that they portend mercy to the Church, and Judgement to others only; it is to be wished that there were a solid foundation for such a conceipt: But alas! Divisions amongst the Lord's professing People themselves, and great Persecutions have oftentimes been the fatal consequents of such portentous signs. And if publick calamities come upon the world, it is not to be expected but that the Lord's People, whilst they are mixed amongst others (and too much partak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them in their sins) living in an evil world, will have their share therein.

                  <p>THE Lord Jesus Christ, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving told his Disciples that great Calamityes were hastning upon Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem, and upon the Jewish Nation; they enquire when those things should come to pass, and what <hi>Signs</hi> should precede and presage the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:44382:85"/> Judgements predicted. This we see in the <hi>7th.</hi> Verse of this Chapter, <hi>They asked Him, saying, Master, but when shall these things be: and what</hi> Sign <hi>will there be when these things shall come to pass?</hi> In Answer unto which Enquiry, the Lord Christ doth in this Context mention several things, some of which were to be more remote, and others more immediate <hi>Signs</hi> of that miserable Destruction, which the sacred and unerring lips of Christ had foretold. 1. False Christs would arise, <hi>V. 8. Many shall come in my Name, saying, I am Christ,</hi> &amp;c. The Jews had rejected the true Messiah, therefore God would punish them with false Christs, as an inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation that the dayes of vengeance were coming upon the Nation for that Sin of theirs. The Apostle <hi>John</hi> (Christ's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Disciple) doth imitate his Master in mentioning the same thing as a Sign that the Jewish World was near unto its end, 1 <hi>Joh. 2. 18. There are many Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christs</hi> b <hi>h. c.</hi> false Christs, such as came in Christ's<note place="margin">Mede's <hi>Works, P. 818, 872.</hi>

                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:44382:85"/> Name, <hi>i. e.</hi> that pretended unto his Office, Dignity, and Authority; and thereby, (saith the Apostle,) <hi>we know that it is the last time;</hi> sc. the Jewish State, both Civil and Ecclesiastical, was come unto the last hour: The Period of the Jewish World was at hand. And the Historyes of those times speak of one <hi>Theudas,</hi> and others, that pretended to be Christs, and that the River <hi>Jordan</hi> should give way to them as once it did to <hi>Joshuah;</hi> so that a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of silly Jews were seduced, &amp; perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to follow them, unto their own destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. 2. Another Sign mentioned, is that of Warres, and Commotions, <hi>V. 9. When you shall hear of Wars and Commoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, be not terrified: for these things must first come to pass; but the end is not by &amp; by.</hi> This may be understood of those <hi>Intestine</hi> Warres and <hi>Commotions,</hi> which hapned in the Land of <hi>Judea.</hi> The <hi>Calileans</hi> took up Arms against the <hi>Samaritans.</hi> At<note n="c" place="margin">Joseph. <hi>Antiq.

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:44382:86"/> great noise and consternation amongst men (especially amongst those of the Jewish Nation) in those dayes. Hence that which is by <hi>Luke</hi> expressed by <hi>Wars</hi> and <hi>Commotions,</hi> is by <hi>Mark</hi> called <hi>Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles;</hi> and by <hi>Matthew, Wars and Rumors of Wars.</hi> And these things hapned about twenty years before the final destruction of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and fatal overthrow of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Nation; therefore was it said, <hi>The end is not by and by.</hi> 3. Another Sign is that mentioned in the <hi>Ioth. V. Nation shall rise up against Nation, and Kingdom against Kingdom.</hi>

In those dayes the Land of <hi>Judea</hi> was divided into several Provinces, which did bear the names of <hi>Kingdoms,</hi> and the chief Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of them are according to the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Style, called <hi>Kings,</hi> being the Vice-Roys which the <hi>Romane</hi> Emperours did substi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute

There were to be <hi>great Earth-Quakes in divers Places.</hi> In the beginning of this Verse.

                  <p>For the further clearing of this Doctrine, three things may be enquired into. 1. What Sights and Signs are the Presages of Calamity? 2. How it doth appear that they are so? 3. What Calamityes such Signs do commonly presage?</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. There are Signs in the <hi>starry Heaven.</hi> The great God, when he made the World, placed the Stars in Heaven, to be for Signs as to Events that in the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Course of Nature should come to pass. <hi>Gen. 1. 14. God said, Let there be lights in the Firmament of heaven, and let them before Signs.</hi> They are for Signs of Heat and Cold, wet and dry Seasons, and the like. Hence the Lord spake to <hi>Job,</hi> as in Ch. 38. 31. <hi>Canst thou bind the sweet Influences of</hi> Pleiades, <hi>or loos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:44382:88"/> those which men call the <hi>Seven Starres.</hi> When the Sun is in that Constellation with the <hi>Pleiades,</hi> it hath great power and Influence upon the Earth. It is Spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time then. As for <hi>Orion</hi>
                     <note n="f" place="margin">
                        <hi>See Mr.</hi> Caryl <hi>on</hi> Job, 38. 31.</note> it is a Winter-Constellation, causing Cold, whereby the pores of the earth are bound. It binds the Earth from bearing Fruit, and as it were binds the hands of Men from labour in their particular Callings. When that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stellation appears in the Evening (as it doth in the ninth Moneth) 'tis a sign that the Earth shall be bound, as hath bin expressed. Yea, and it is a sign that Storms and tempestuous seasons are to be expected. Therefore was it by the Poet called <hi>Nimbosus Orion.</hi> And hence the Stars are called by the name of the <hi>Signs of heaven,</hi> Jer. 10. 2. <hi>Learn not the way of the heathen, and be not dismayed at the Signs of heaven.</hi> Which words may well be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood concerning the Stars and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stellations in the heavens. <note n="g" place="bottom">

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:44382:88"/> the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> especially (among whom the <hi>Jews</hi> were then going to dwell) superstitiously imagin'd that the Stars were Rulers of the World, and did there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore stand in fear of them, and worship them; which heathenish Idolatry the Lord doth caution and charge his People against. The Stars of Heaven are for na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Signs. Their Motions and Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances are significations that such and such things, will according to that Course of Nature which God hath setled, come to pass in the World. There are also <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Stars,</hi> sometimes appearing in the Heavens. God in his Providence doth so order, as that sometimes, <hi>Blazing Stars</hi> are seen in heaven▪ Such <hi>Stars</hi> are called <hi>Comets,</hi> from the stream like long Hair, which useth to attend them. Such a Star is <hi>Prodigious,</hi> and a <hi>Fearful Sight.</hi> And of this may the words of the Text be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood. The <hi>Jewish</hi>

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:44382:89"/> form of a Sword, which seemed to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend over the City, for a Year together: This now was a <hi>fearful Sight,</hi> and a <hi>great Sign from Heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2 There are fearful Sights and Signs appearing in the <hi>Air,</hi> sometimes in the lower heaven, which we move &amp; breathe in. Prodigious Meteors are sometimes seen there. And strange Appearances, which are either seen, or heard speaking. Of these fearful sights and signs, is the Text likewise to be interpreted. <hi>Josephus</hi> relates, that before the <hi>Romane</hi> Army de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> there were seen in the Air, Iron Chariots, and Souldiers in bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel aray; and in the night time, a great Light appeared in the Temple, for half an hour together, with as much brightness as if it had been noon day; and a Voice was heard saying, <hi>Let us be gone from hence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Qu. 2. <hi>How doth it appear that such Fearful Sights are Presages of Calamityes coming upon the World?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. The Scripture is clear for this. The Text before us doth expresly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:44382:89"/> no less. And the Prophet <hi>Joel</hi> foretelling the same Calamityes which this Text hath reference unto, saith also, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious Signs in heaven should presage and portend them. <hi>Joel, 2. 30, 31. I will shew Wonders in the heaven.</hi> Truly, Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing Stars are Wonders in the heaven. <hi>And in the Earth, blood, and fire, and pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of smoke before the great and the terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Day of the Lord come.</hi> When <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> was destroyed, and the <hi>Jewish</hi> state dissolved, that was a great and notable Day of the Lord, a Type of the great Day of Judgement. <hi>Wonders,</hi> even pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious and amazing Signs should precede it. A very learned <hi>l</hi> and judicious Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter conceiveth that the <hi>Hebrews</hi> of old did use to call<note place="margin">(<hi>i</hi>) Mede <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course. 6.

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:44382:90"/> that Comets should precede and presage the miseryes coming upon the <hi>Jewish</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

                     <hi>Ans.</hi> We must not be particular and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:44382:92"/> positive in Interpretations of things of this nature. When a fearful Sight ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in heaven, which the whole World cannot but take notice of, now to make a particular and absolute determination <note n="p" place="bottom">

                     </note> that such a Place, or such a Person, such a Judgement, is certainly intended there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, is too much boldness. In general, we may safely say, that there is just cause to expect that great Calamityes are at hand: but what Persons or Places shall more eminently fall under those Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, is not for us to determine; but we must leave that with God, who best knows what him self intends to do.</p>
                  <p>This being premised, we proceed in Answering the Enquiry before us.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Sometimes such Signs are Presages of great Persecutions coming upon the Church of God. The Lord in mercy to his People, giveth them such Warnings, that so they may prepare for what's a coming, or make haste to enter into the Chambers of safety, as it were for a little
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:44382:93"/> moment, till the Indignation be overpast. <hi>Ner<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

The same is true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Arian</hi> Heresy and persecution; that flood spoken of in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> which the Dragon cast out of his mouth, and whereby the Woman, the Church, fled into the Wilderness, was in eminent danger of being swallowed up and devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 15.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Sometimes such Signs in heaven are Presages of miserable Dearths and Scarcity. That Blazing Star impending over <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> which the Text hath refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence unto, was attended with a terrible Famine, whereby multitudes perished <note n="q" place="bottom">
                        <hi>In the Years after Christ, 876. 948. 964. there were Blazing Stars seen, presaging Famines &amp; other Judgements.</hi> In Annis 674, 675, 676. <hi>Comets appeared, and sore Droughts followed: In some Countryes it rained not for 3 Years together. The like Miseryes followed the Comet</hi> Anno 1477. In Annis 594. 1527. 1542. <hi>Comets were seen, and Armies of Locusts followed, devouring the Fruits of the Earth.</hi>
                     </note> And therefore such Signs are frequently portentous of those Judgements, which
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:44382:93"/> cause Want and scarcity, <hi>e. gr.</hi> of sore Droughts and Blastings, and the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of noxious Creatures that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy the Fruits of the Earth.

                  <p>Thus have we seen what Judgements and Calamityes, <hi>Fearful Sights in heaven</hi> are commonly the Presages of. As for that <hi>SIGN</hi> in heaven, now appearing, (which hath occasioned me to speak this Word at this time) what Calamityes may be portended thereby, which of the Judgements mentioned, or whether all of them be not thereby presaged, I shall not say; but leave it unto God and Time to discover.

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:44382:97"/> the Event was quite otherwise. And let us not make our selves secure, by saying or thinking, that the Lord by such <hi>fearful Sights</hi> speaks to <hi>others onely,</hi> and not unto <hi>us.</hi> As <hi>Vespasian</hi> the Emperour, when <note n="z" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Testante</hi> Suetonio</note> there was a long <hi>hairy Comet</hi> seen, he did but deride at it, and make a Joke of it, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That it concerned the <hi>Parthians</hi> that wore long hair, and not him, who was bald: but within a Year, <hi>Vespasian</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self (and not the <hi>Parthian</hi>) dyed. Such fearful Sights are usually Signs, that those Judgements, which are (as <hi>Tertullian</hi> speaks) <hi>Tonsurae humani generis,</hi> God's sharp Razors on Mankind, whereby He doth poll, his Sythe, whereby He doth shear down multitudes of sinful Creatures, doe draw near: In which respect, there is no doubt to be made of it, but that God by this <hi>Blazing-star,</hi> is speaking to other Places, and not to <hi>New England</hi> onely. And it may be, He is declaring to that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of hairy Scalps, who go on still in their Trespasses, that the day of their Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:44382:98"/> is at hand, and that the things which shal come upon them make haste. A <hi>strange Sight</hi> doth betoken <hi>strange Punishment</hi> coming upon those that have been prodi gious workers of Iniquity. Yet let not us promise to our selves nothing but Prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in the doleful &amp; the bitter Day, when there shall be Lamentation generally. I am perswaded, that the floods of great water are coming. I am perswaded that God is about to open the windows of heaven, and to pour down the Cataracts of his Wrath, ere this Generation (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>Atheism</hi> and <hi>Profaneness</hi> are come to such a prodigious height) I say, ere this Generation is passed away. But what reason have we to think that no drops of the fatal Storm shall come near to us? If we so conclude, we may provoke the Lord to say, <hi>The Sinners of my People shall dye by the Sword, who say, The Evil shall not overtake us nor prevent us.</hi> To be awakened out of Security, and trembling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to wait for the good Pleasure of God, whatever it may be, is the most likely
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:44382:98"/> way to find Rest in the day of Trouble. So did the Prophet find it, <hi>Hab. 3. 16. When I heard, my belly trembled, my lips quivered, I trembled in my self, that I might rest in the Day of Trouble.</hi> When the thundring voice of Judgement was heard, his heart Tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>mbled at it, so did he find Rest in the Day of Trouble.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>This should put us upon preparing for another Day of Trouble.</hi> And this should we do the rather, since the Changes por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by this <hi>Comet,</hi> are like to come <hi>speedily</hi> as well as <hi>certainly. Joseph</hi> said to <hi>Pharaoh, For that the Dream is doubled, it is because the thing is established by God, &amp; God will shortly bring it to pass.</hi> Gen. 41. 32 Doth not the <hi>doubled Appearance</hi> of this Fearful Sight in the heavens speak as much? Let us then prepare for Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. We should not onely expect it; but so expect it, as to prepare for it. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly we have reason so to do. If there had been no <hi>Blazing-star,</hi> yet upon other accounts, we have cause to expect and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:44382:99"/> prepare for <hi>another Day of Trouble,</hi> which seems to be hastning upon thee O <hi>NEW-ENGLAND,</hi> and upon thee, O <hi>BO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STON!</hi> The <hi>Sins</hi> which are amongst us, are surer and blacker Signs of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than any <hi>Signs in heaven,</hi> that we may think of. I say the Sins, the <hi>Pride,</hi> the <hi>Profaneness,</hi> the <hi>Worldliness,</hi> the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Security</hi> and <hi>Iniquity</hi> that prevaileth amongst us. Especially considering how little good all former Judgements and Dispensations have done upon us. What <hi>Fiery Desolations</hi> hath the Lord made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us? The Lord hath been roaring out of <hi>Sion▪</hi> Such roaring Judgements have been amongst us, as that the Report of them hath been heard afar off. <hi>Sword, Death,</hi> and <hi>Fire.</hi> But (alass! O Lord God) may it not be said concerning the generality of men, They return not to Him that hath been smiting of them? They are the same since the <hi>War,</hi> since the <hi>Small-Pox,</hi> since the <hi>Fires,</hi> that they were before. Ah! what will come next? We have cause to expect, and it vvill be
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:44382:99"/> our vvisdom to prepare for <hi>another Day of Trouble</hi> seven times greater than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. It grieveth me to speak thus, but I cannot forbear. I feel that the Word of the Lord is like a fire in a mans bones, and it will break out. The Lord God hath spoken, who can but prophesy? And now know for certain, that if destroying Judgements and Death overtake any in their Sins, and sweep them avvay to Hell, their blood shall be upon their own heads. For the Lord hath fired his Beacon in the heavens, among the Stars of God there; the <hi>Fearful Sight</hi> is not yet out of sight. The <hi>Warning-piece</hi> in heaven is going off, now then if the Lord discharge his <hi>Murdering-pieces</hi> from on high, and men be found in their Sins, unfit for Death, their blood shall be upon them. They had Warning given them that the Sword was a coming: Lo, the Lord himself gave them the warning; but they would not take vvarning, their blood shall be upon them. Moreover, if Troubles should not come, yet it vvill be vvisdom to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:44382:100"/> for them. If the Lord, after Hee hath sent his Angel to stand with a drawn Sword over <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> should be entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to spare us, yet it will never do us hurt to prepare for the most deadly Arrows of Affliction that may light upon us, vvhilst in this Vale of Tears.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>We should do what in us lyes to divert those Judgements, which seem to be impen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and blazing over our heads.</hi> This word of Comfort, I may safely speak, <hi>The Lord's Threatenings are not absolute; but conditional.</hi> So far as we in these ends of the Earth, these goings down of the Sun, are spoken unto, by this <hi>Sign in the heavens,</hi> it is possible we may escape the Evils threatened thereby, if we duely hearken to the Voice of God therein. <hi>Jer. 18. 7, 8. At what time I speak concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a Nation &amp; concerning a Kingdome, to pluck up, and to pull down, and to destroy it: if that Nation against whom I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, turn from their Evil, I will repent of the Evil that I thought to doe unto them.</hi> So that when desolating Judgements are
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:44382:100"/> threatned, either by the Word, or by the awful Works of God, those denuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Wrath are not <hi>absolute,</hi> but <hi>condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional.</hi> If Repentance intervene, the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils which otherwise must be looked for, may be diverted. See therefore <hi>Jer. 36 3, 7. It may be the house of</hi> Judah <hi>will hear all the Evil which I purpose to do unto them, that they may return ev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ry man from his evil way.</hi> Ay, a general Repentance is that which will do, if every man turn from his evil way, <hi>that I may forgive their Iniquity and their sin. It may be they will present their Supplication before the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. This is that which the Lord would have; therefore He saith, I'le stir up the spirit of my Ministers and Ambassadors, that they shall declare and denounce my Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments against a sinful Generation. <hi>It may be they will hear.</hi> And I'le speak by awful Signs from heaven, that may be as He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raulds to proclaim <hi>Wrath and Wo</hi> to the World, <hi>It may be they will hear,</hi> and then shall their sins be forgiven. You will say, <hi>But what shall we do, that so the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:44382:101"/> which are blazing over us, may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted from us? Answ.</hi> Pray, and cry mightily to Heaven. For this let every one that is godly pray unto the Lord in a time wherein He may be found, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Floods of great waters come nigh unto us. Our Lord Jesus Christ, having warned his Disciples of approaching Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamityes, He concludeth vvith an Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation unto Prayer, <hi>Luk, 21 36. Pray al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, that you may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass.</hi> Prayer may do much toward the averting of wrathful Judgements and Desolations. When the Lord threatned to bring Famin and Destruction upon his People, <hi>Amos</hi> fell to praying; and God said, <hi>This shall not be,</hi> this Judgement and threatned de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation shall not be. <hi>Amos</hi> 7. 3, 6. O then, let us deprecate impending Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Do vve see the Sword <hi>blazing</hi> over us? Let it put us upon crying to God, that that Judgement may be diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and not return upon us again so spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily. Do vve see the Arrows of Pesti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lence
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:44382:101"/> and Death <hi>blazing</hi> over us? Oh! Pray that the destroying Angel may not be sent to vvalk in darkness, and to vvaste at noon day. Doth God threaten our very Heavens? O pray unto Him, that He vvould not take away <hi>Stars</hi> and send <hi>Comets</hi> to succeed them. Pray that the Lord Jesus, vvho holds the Stars in His right Hand, may continue those in the Firmament of his Churches (the Heaven vvhich his own Hand hath planted) who are indeed <hi>Stars,</hi> vvilling to impart the Light vvhich they have received from Christ, unto his People: and that <hi>wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring Stars, blazing Stars, seducing Spirits</hi> may never come in their room. I am not vvithout fear, that this vvill at last be the Judgement of God upon <hi>New England</hi> and upon these Churches. Pray that it may never be. And our <hi>Supplications</hi> should be attended vvith deep <hi>Humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> Zeph. 2. 2, 3. <hi>Gather your selves toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> h. e. Come before the Lord in a vvay of publick, solemn Humiliation, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the decree,</hi> i. e. the Judgement written
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:44382:102"/> and threatned, <hi>ering forth, before the fierce anger of the Lord come upon you, before the day of the Lord's anger come upon you: seek the Lord—It may be you shall be hid in the day of the Lord's anger.</hi> Thus then should we do in this day, vvhen there are such dark &amp; angry Clouds hanging over our heads; and vve know not how soon they may break upon us. And truly, if our <hi>Lectures,</hi> were, some of them, turned into dayes of <hi>Prayer,</hi> at such a time as this, it is no more than vvhat there is cause for. And there is one thing more, that should in special be remembred by us; a thing that hath been much talk'd of; but little hath been done in it, that is, <hi>Reformation! Reformation!</hi> When the Prophet <hi>Jonah</hi> vvas sent of God to preach and say, <hi>Yet forty dayes, and</hi> Nineveh <hi>shall be destroyed:</hi> that was a more awful Sign of Desolation, than if they had seen a <hi>Blazingstar</hi> hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over the City, menacing the Ruine thereof: Yet vvhen they repented, and <hi>reformed</hi> (though it vv as but an external Reformation) the Lord spared them
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:44382:102"/> forty years longer. Ah! <hi>New-England,</hi> wilt thou not do more than <hi>Nineveh?</hi> shall there not be so much as an <hi>external Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi> of those things that provoke the glorious Eyes of Heaven? Will not the haughty Daughters of Sion, reform their Pride in Apparel? Will they have <hi>the Attire of an Harlot?</hi> Will they lay out their Hair, and wear their false Locks, their Borders, and Towers like <hi>Comets,</hi> about their heads? Will they do so, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till God send his Arrows from Heaven, to smite them down into the Grave, where the dayes of Darkness shall be many? And shall there be still such a multitude of <hi>Licensed Drinking▪ Houses</hi> (and Town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwellers frequenting them) to the Shame of <hi>Boston,</hi> and to the Infamy of <hi>New-England;</hi> notwithstanding the Testimony which God, and his Servants have given against it? How then shall we think to escape in the Day of the Lord's Anger; if a <hi>Reformation,</hi> so much as in these Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, which it is so easy to reform, will not be obtained? O Return, Return unto
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:44382:103"/> the Lord. And in that way let us betake our selves unto the shading Wings of the Lord Jesus! Do we not hear Him speaking to us, as sometimes unto <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,?</hi> Mat. 23. 37. <hi>O Jerusalem, Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, how often would I have gathered thee, as an Hen her Chickens under her wings.</hi> Saith the Lord, The <hi>Roman</hi> Eagles, those birds of prey, are hastening upon you: But if you would have come under My Wings, you should have been safe enough. Even so, doth not the Lord say, O <hi>New England! New England!</hi> dost thou not know that the birds of prey are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing to devour thee? But my Wings are broad enough to secure and shelter thee, when the black and stormy tempest shall break upon the World.

                  <p>IN the preceding Chapter, we have an Account of <hi>Moses</hi> his being sent to the children of <hi>Israel,</hi> in order to their Deliverance out of Egypt: As also of his sense of the Difficulty of that Undertaking; Whence he did entreat the Lord, that
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:44382:105"/> some other Person might rather be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed therein. A man may possibly be called of God unto special Service a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst his People, and yet find a present averseness and unwillingness in his own spirit, thereunto. <hi>Moses</hi> was at first very unwilling to ingage in that difficult work, which the Lord put him upon; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he made diverse Objections, which, untill God himself answered them, he could not be perswaded to comply there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. His first Objection was from the consideration of his own personal Unfit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness for such a Service. That Excuse is obviated and removed in the former Chapter. <hi>Moses</hi> his second Objection was, that the children of <hi>Israel</hi> would not believe that God had sent him to them upon such an Errand. In the first Verse of this Chapter. <hi>They will not believe me, nor hearken to my Voice: for they will say, The Lord hath not appeared unto thee.</hi> The Lord was graciously pleased to conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend to answer this Objection also; and that in a miraculous way. And therein
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:44382:105"/> we have 1. The Miracles that were done. Whilest <hi>Moses</hi> was yet in the Desert, vvhere God appeared to him, there vvere two Miracles vvrought before his Eyes, to confirm &amp; encourage him in his Calling. At this Time <hi>Moses</hi> was keeping the flock of <hi>Jethro</hi> his Father in Law: And as Shepherds vvere vvont to carry a Rod or Pastoral Staff in their hands, vvhereby they did direct and govern their Sheep (in allusion unto vvhich Custome, <hi>David</hi> in one of the <hi>Psalms,</hi> having said, The Lord is my Shepherd, adds, <hi>Let his Rod and his Staff comfort me</hi>) thus <hi>Moses</hi> had his <hi>Shepherd</hi>'s <hi>Rod</hi> in his hand, vvhich at the Word of the Lord, hee cast on the ground; and it became a Serpent: and vvhen the Lord said unto him, Put forth thy hand, and take it by the tail, he did so and it became a Rod again. V. 2, 3, 4▪ In those Miracles, vvhich the Scripture speaks of, there vvas many times an <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy</hi> to be observed, between the Miracle, and the thing adumbrated thereby. And so there vvas in this Miracle. If we look
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:44382:106"/> upon the past, present, and future state of the children of <hi>Israel,</hi> it vvas not unfitly represented by this <hi>Sign.</hi> For the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Israel</hi>
                     <note n="b" place="margin">Lyranus <hi>in locum. Quamvis pleri{que}</hi> Hebraeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, <hi>Serpentem, de</hi> Pharaone <hi>&amp;</hi> Aegyptijs' <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretantur.</hi>
                     </note> in the dayes of <hi>Joseph,</hi> vvere like unto a Rod, in respect of Liberty and Power: But after his Death, they vvere cast to the ground, and became as vile and odious as Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, to the <hi>Aegyptians.</hi> Thus the Rod vvas turned into a Serpent. Moreover, the children of <hi>Israel,</hi> vvere by the hand of <hi>Moses</hi> brought out of a vile and abject Condition, into a state of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and Power. Thus vvas the Serpent turned into a Rod again. And this vvas the <hi>first Sign.</hi> The Second vvas that of <hi>Moses</hi>'s Hand becoming leprous; and all on a sudden restored again. Verse. 6, 7. This vvas every vvay miraculous. For the Disease of the <hi>Leprosy</hi> is not cured so suddenly, vvithout a Miracle. Thus <hi>Moses, c</hi> vvho like a leprous person, vvas <hi>c</hi> Rivet <hi>in locum.</hi> a long time excluded
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:44382:106"/> from the Society of the Lord's People, being banished into a Wilderness, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued like a man half dead and buried in a desert Land, all on a sudden is revived and turned into another man, being sent an Ambassador from the God of Heaven unto his People in <hi>Egypt.</hi> 2. Wee have here expressed, that which vvas the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Design and Intendment of these Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles; <hi>viz.</hi> that so the People, in whose sight they should afterwards be done, might be induced to believe the Word of God spoken by <hi>Moses.</hi> V. 5. For which cause there must be one strange Sign after another. The Verse before us to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of, speaks of two: and the next Verse mentions a third. And although the Lord does hear express himself <hi>conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,</hi> saying [<hi>If</hi>] they will not hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to the voice of the first Sign, then they will believe the voice of the latter Sign, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The meaning is not, as though the Omniscient God did not know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther one Sign would not effect that which was the proper end thereof, or no: But
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:44382:107"/> the Lord is pleased to speak after the manner of Men; who if one Attempt fail, they'l try another, and then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and a third after that, untill at last they have what they ayme at. So (saith God to <hi>Moses</hi>) I'le give thee power to work Miracle upon Miracle, untill at last the end of all be accomplished. The words imply, that it was a Duty to hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to God's Voice in <hi>One</hi> Sign, much more in <hi>diverse.</hi> And that the children of <hi>Israel</hi> should hear the Lord's Voice therein; and that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> not hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening thereunto, would be left the more inexcusable.</p>
                  <p>The Doctrine which the words afford unto us, is,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That men ought to Hear the Voice of God in Signal Providences, especially when repeated and Iterated.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are three things which may be enquired into, for the clearing of this Doctrine. 1. What signal Providences
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:44382:107"/> are they the Voice whereof ought to be hearkned unto? 2. When men may be said to Hear the Lord's Voice therein? 3. The Reasons why they should do thus.</p>
                  <p>Q. 1. <hi>What Signal Providences are they, the Voice whereof should be Hearkned unto?</hi> What Works of God are we to look upon as Signal? <hi>Ans.</hi> In general, <note n="d" place="margin">

Such Works of God are called <hi>Signs</hi> in the Scripture. Thus some <note n="f" place="margin">

                     </note> judicious Expositors in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret those Words, <hi>Psal. 74. 9. We see not our Signs,</hi> as notifying the <hi>Extraordinary,</hi> as well as the <hi>Ordinary</hi> stated Signs of God's Presence. As if the Lord's People should there speak after the same manner as <hi>Gideon</hi> once did (<hi>Judg.</hi> 6. 13.) Where are all the Miracles, which our Fathers told us of? We see not our Signs, we see not those Miracles, which in the dayes of our Fathers were seen. The Lord doth not appear in that miraculous way for our Deliverance, as He did for
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:44382:108"/> them. However, it is certain, that in many other Scriptures <hi>Miracles</hi> are called <hi>Signs. Mar. 16. 17. Act.</hi> 4. 30. For they are certain <hi>Signs</hi> of God's powerful presence with them, by whose hands they are wrought, &amp; that therefore they are sent of God. The Miracles done by <hi>Moses,</hi> were Signs that God sent him, and was with him. When <hi>John Baptist</hi> sent his Disciples (not that he doubted thereof, onely that their Faith might be confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med) to Christ, to enquire whether he was indeed the true <hi>Messiah,</hi> or no; the Lord Christ to convince them of it, told them what Miracles were wrought by Him. Those Miracles were <hi>Signs, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, Demonstrations</hi> from Heaven, that Christ was as He professed himself to be, the Son of God, and Saviour of the World. And the Miracles which the Lord wrought by the Apostles, were <hi>Signs</hi> of the powerful Presence of God with them, and that the Doctrine which they taught, was from Heaven.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There are Portentous Signs. Such
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:44382:109"/> as we call Prodigies, which are Intimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Signs either of the Mercy, or of the Wrath of Heaven toward the children of Men. The Plagues of <hi>Egypt</hi> were of a prodigious nature. When Water was turned into Blood, it was a prodigious <hi>Sign</hi> that the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> for their bloody Cruelty in murdering the Male <hi>Israelitish</hi> Infants, should themselves dye and perish in the Waters. There were prodigious Thunders, and storms of Fire and Haile, and prodigious Darkness throughout the Land; and a sudden prodigious multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of noxious Creatures, destroying the Fruits of the Earth: All which <hi>strange Providences</hi> were <hi>Signs</hi> portending the destruction of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the salvation of <hi>Israel.</hi> There are indeed some prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Signs,</hi> which are also Miracles; many of those in <hi>Egypt,</hi> were so. There are other portentous Signs, which are not Miracles properly; but strange Workes of Providence. Such as Blazingstars, and strange Apparitions on the Earth, or in the heavens. There were <hi>Fearful Sights
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:44382:109"/> and great Signs from heaven,</hi> portending the Destruction of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and Ruine to the <hi>Jewish</hi> Nation, as I have formerly had occasion to shew from <hi>Luk.</hi> 21. 11. Signs of this nature, are sometimes called <hi>Tokens</hi> in the Scripture, because they use to <hi>betoken</hi> some eminent Work of God, and gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Sometimes they are called <hi>Wonders,</hi> for that they use to cause great VVonderment and Admiration to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst Mortals on the Earth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Act. 2. 19, 20. <hi>I will shew Wonders in heaven above, and Signs in the earth beneath: blood and fire and vapour of smoak. The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and notable day of the Lord come.</hi> Prodigies <note n="g" place="bottom">

                     </note> are oftentimes Signs portending some great and notable Day of the Lord to be at hand.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There are signal Mercyes of God. Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Mercyes and Deliverances are sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Providences. Providences that are
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:44382:110"/> by way of eminency called <hi>marveilous lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving kindness.</hi> Psal. 17. 7. Sometimes God is extraordinarily gracious to the children of men; and He is then said to <hi>do great things for them.</hi> He bestoweth such Mercyes on them, as that themselves who are the subjects thereof, cannot but vvonder at. He maketh them to marvel at his Goodness. <hi>Zech. 8. 6. If it be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veilous in your eyes.</hi> Yea, and others that see or hear thereof, to vvonder also. When the great ones of the Earth beheld vvhat God had done for his Servants of old, <hi>they saw it and marvelled.</hi> Psal. 48. 5. Such Mercyes are <hi>signal.</hi> For they argue the great and admirable Goodness of God; and are sometimes <hi>Signs</hi> of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Favour towards them that are the subjects of them, Hence <hi>David</hi> speaks as <hi>Psal. 86. 17. Shew me a Token</hi> (or a <hi>Sign:</hi> the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word there is the same with that in my Text) <note n="h" place="bottom">Ravanelli <hi>Biblioth▪ sacr. in verbo</hi> Signum.</note>
                     <hi>for good, that they that hate me may see.</hi> He prayeth that the Lord would save him out of his
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:44382:110"/> Afflictions in such an eminent vvay, as that his Enemyes might by such a bright <hi>Sign</hi> of God's Favour to <hi>David,</hi> be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced thereof, and be ashamed of their Enmity against him, whom the God of Heaven did manifest peculiar Love unto. The Lord's own People are many times the subjects of signal Mercyes and Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. When they are brought into such straits and Difficulties, as that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not help themselves, and there is none else to deliver them, now God steps in, and by his Wonder-working Providence saveth them. When the children of <hi>Israel</hi> were made Slaves in the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> there was little hope that they should ever be delivered: but God by vvonderfull Providences brought it to pass. And their deliverance out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> was a greater Work than that. <hi>Jer.</hi> 16. 14, 15. For the Emperour of <hi>Babylon</hi> was a more po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Oppressor than <hi>Pharaoh.</hi> The Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Empire was more unlikely than the ruine of the Kingdom of <hi>Egypt;</hi> yet God by signal Providences
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:44382:111"/> brought it about, in Mercy to his People. Such Providences are <hi>Signs</hi> of God's spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Care of his Church in the World.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. There are signal Judgements: <hi>Wonderfull Plagues,</hi> as the Scripture ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression is. <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. 58. Such Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as one may plainly see the Finger of God in them. The great Persecutors and Oppressors of his People, are often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times smitten in such a way, as that it is manifest that God hath done it. They are so high, as that <hi>men</hi> cannot come at them, but therefore the <hi>Lord</hi> removeth them by invisible strokes of his Hand, or of some Angel, whom He sends from Heaven for that purpose; as it was with <hi>Herod,</hi> and with <hi>Senacherib's</hi> Host. Sometimes men are visited with rare and Unusual Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. There are <hi>Prodigies of Judgement</hi> falling down from Heaven upon the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full children of men. These are expressed in the Scripture, by that of an <hi>Overflowing Scourge.</hi> Isai. 28. 18. A Judgement that doth not keep within ordinary Banks and bounds, is an Overflowing Scourge. As
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:44382:111"/> when sudden destruction cometh and that upon many at once. When <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his Host, were all drowned in the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> it was a signal Judgement. The Lord shewed the Greatness of his Excellency, in overthrowing them that rose up against Him. It was such a Judgment as did asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish the World. The Dukes of <hi>Edom</hi> were amazed at it, Trembling took hold on the mighty Men of <hi>Moab,</hi> and all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of <hi>Canaan</hi> did e'en melt away at the Report of what was done. When the Flood came upon the Old VVorld, and thousands of Millions of sinful Creatures perished together, it vvas a signal Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And when Fire (which useth to fly upward) contrary to its nature, fell down in streams and showers upon the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domites,</hi> to punish them for their Unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Abominations, when (as one of the Ancients speaks) <hi>Hell was rained down out of Heaven</hi> upon those worse than hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Sinners, it vvas a signal Judgement. And indeed, all publick and general Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities, may be called <hi>signal;</hi> because
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:44382:112"/> they are <hi>Signs</hi> of the mighty Power, and of the great Wrath of the Holy God.</p>
                  <p>We come now to the second Enquiry, viz. <hi>When men may be said to Hear the Voice of God in signal Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences? Answ.</hi> 1. VVhen they are thereby brought to believe his VVord. The Lord's usual method is, first to speak to men by his Word, and if that taketh place, well and good: but if his Word be not regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, then He speaks by <hi>signal Providences,</hi> one after another. The special Design of such solemn works of God, is to confirm his Word. When the Lord wrought such Signs in the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> it was (as hath been intimated) that People, both <hi>Israelites</hi> and <hi>Egyptians,</hi> might be induced to believe the word: which <hi>Moses</hi> spake in the Name of the Lord. The Scripture spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of the <hi>Sign</hi> of the prophet <hi>Jonah,</hi> because <note n="i" place="bottom">Ravanellus <hi>ubi snpra.</hi>
                     </note>
                     <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah's</hi> miraculous Deliverance out of the Whale's belly, was to be a <hi>Sign</hi> to the <hi>Ninevites,</hi> that God had sent him. As in the Antitype, when Christ was raised out of the Grave, that was a Sign that He was no Impostor, as the wicked <hi>Jews</hi> blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously called Him; but the true Messiah sent of God. The Gift of working Miracles in the Primitive Times, was that so men might believe the Gospel. Signal Mercyes are bestowed upon men, that so they might believe the Truth of his Promises; and signal Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that so they might believe his Threatenings. Yea, and when there is a <hi>portentous Sign</hi> appearing in the heavens, it is; that so men might believe the Word of God. Therefore when they do thus, they may be said to Hear the Voice of God in such signal Providences.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When men are by such signal Providences awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened to Fear that God, who speaketh to them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:44382:112"/> and thereby, they may be said to hear his Voice there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. Signal Mercyes call upon men to fear the Lord &amp; his Goodness: Signal Judgemens call upon them to fear the Lord and his Greatness. Yea, supposing those Judgements to be upon others onely, not for the present amongst our selves, we should be awakened greatly, to fear that God, whose Name is dreadful in all the Earth. When the Lord cut off the Nations round about, and made their Towers desolate, He said of Jerusalem, <hi>Surely they will Fear me.</hi> Zeph. 3. 7. They that pour out the Vials full of Plagues upon the <hi>Antichristian</hi> world, say, <hi>Great and marveilous are thy Works, Lord God Almighty, Who would not Fear thee?</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rev.</hi> 15. 3, 4. God brings marveilous Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on his Enemyes; and bestows marveilous Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on his People; all that hear thereof, should learn to Fear Him. And the like is to be affirmed with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to portentous Signs in the Heaven. For such a Sign doth, as tis said in the <hi>Revelation</hi> concerning the Angel which flew through the midst of heaven, Ch. 14. V. 7. <hi>He said with a loud voice, Fear God and give glory to Him, for the hour of his Judgement is come.</hi> So doth such a Sign in heaven (especially if it be not a first; but a <hi>Latter Sign</hi>) cry with a loud voice, that all the World may hear, <hi>Fear God, and give glory to Him, for the hour of his Judgement is near at hand.</hi> And therefore they that are thereby awakened to fear Him, may tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be said <hi>to Hear his Voice</hi> in such signal Dispensations of his Providence towards men here below. As that great Emperour <note n="k" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Ludovicus I. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roli Magni filius.</hi>
                     </note> who when there was a Blazingstar appearing, and some told him he should not be afraid, because the Scripture saith, <hi>Be not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayed at the Signs of Heaven;</hi> replyed, but <hi>It becomes us to fear that God, who hath
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:44382:113"/> made this Sign in the heavens, and to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire his Goodness, in that he giveth us war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning before He smiteth us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. When men practise according to what the Lord calls for, they may be said to Hear his Voice, in his Signal and Solemn Dispensations. To <hi>Hear,</hi> in Scripture-language, is to <hi>Obey.</hi> Isa. 55. 3. <hi>Hear (i. e.</hi> obey) <hi>and your Souls shall live.</hi> And when God doth so often promise Mercy unto those that hearken to his Commandments; such as yield Obedience thereunto, are intended. The children of <hi>Israel</hi> did <hi>hear</hi> the voice of those Signs the Text speaks of, when they <hi>obeyed</hi> the Lord's Call, in departing out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> as Hee commanded them. God requires men to forsake the ways of Sin; and to walk in contrary ways of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, and new Obedience before Him. Now if they shall by any signal Providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces be prevailed upon so to do, then do they hear the Lord's voice therein.</p>
                  <p>Qu. 3 <hi>But why should men thus Hear the Voice of Signal Providences? Ans.</hi> I shall
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:44382:113"/> mention only one <hi>Reason,</hi> and that shall be from the Consideration of <hi>the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Greatness of Him that speaketh in, and by such Providences.</hi> It is the <hi>LORD,</hi> the <hi>MIGHTY GOD,</hi> that is then cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling upon the <hi>Spectators,</hi> or Subjects of such Works of his. As for his Power of <hi>Might,</hi> it is Infinite. He is able as easily to destroy men, as to speak to them. He that by a word's speaking, made the World, is able by the breath of his Mouth to annihilate any Creature. Therefore they are highly concerned to Hear <hi>when</hi> and <hi>what</hi> He speaketh to them. And as for his Power of <hi>Authority,</hi> it is Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal, and Absolute. Divine Testimony ought to be received on that sole account of the Authority of the Speaker. Hence often in the Scripture, it is said, <hi>Hear the Word of the LORD,</hi> and <hi>Thus saith the LORD:</hi> intimating, that because of the Authority of the Speaker, men have infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Reason to Hear and Fear, and to Believe and Obey.</p>

                     </gap>y of Instruction. 1. <hi>Hence
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:44382:114"/> great is their Sin, who despise, or disregard the Signal Workes of God.</hi> When the Lord speaketh to men by signal Eminent Mercyes, but they will not hearken to his Voice therein, their Evil is great. When they are not thereby led unto Repentance, and to love and serve the God of their Mercyes, and Deliverances▪ Such have no reason to expect other, but that God will change the tenor of his Dispensations towards them; yea, that He will do them hurt, after he hath done them good. <hi>Josh.</hi> 24. 20. and that they shall become as eminent Examples for Judgement, as ever they were for Mercy. <hi>You onely have I known of all the families of the earth, therefore I will punish you for all your iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</hi> Amos, 3. 2. Or when God speaks to a People by signal Judgements, one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another: by strange Punishments; by Unusual Rebukes of his Providence: For them not to hear, nor regard the Voice of the Lord therein, is great Iniquity. It ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueth desperate hardness of heart. Were not mens hearts exceeding hard; should
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:44382:114"/> God but speak to them by his <hi>Word,</hi> they would immediately fall down before it, as tender-hearted <hi>Josiah</hi> did: But then, if he speaks by signal and dismal <hi>Afflictions,</hi> and that in an iterated way, <hi>a First, and a Latter Sign</hi> of his Displeasure; in case men will not <hi>now</hi> hear and obey, their hearts are like <hi>Leviathan</hi>'s, <hi>as hard as a stone, and firmer than a piece of the nether millstone,</hi> Nay, it is many times a black Sign of that Hardness of heart, which is a fearful Consequent of eternal Reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For was it not thus with the Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate heart of <hi>Pharaoh?</hi> One awful Sign of God's Displeasure came upon him, and he regarded it not; and then another, <hi>neither did he set his heart unto this also.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And when God speaketh to men by portentous Signs in the heaven; by a <hi>first and a Latter Sign,</hi> then for them to disre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard it, or to make light of it, is a great Sin. Mind, I pray you, what the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture saith, <hi>Job. 36. 24, 25. Remember that thou magnifie his Work, which men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold. Every man may see it, men may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:44382:115"/> it afar off.</hi> So it is when there is a Sign blazing amongst the Stars of heaven, every man seeth it, they behold it afar off; now they ought not to despise; but to magnifie such Works of God. And as for those that do profanely contemn such signal Works of the most High, there is an awful Scripture, the Consideration whereof may strike Cold to their hearts; I mean that in the <hi>28th</hi> Psalm, the <hi>5th</hi> V. where it is said; <hi>Because they regard not the Workes of the Lord, nor the Operation of his hands, He shall destroy them, and not build them up.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Instr. 2. <hi>Hence then, the Works of God have a Voice in them, as well as his Word. Austin</hi> calls the Sacraments, <hi>Verba visibilia:</hi> Even so the Works of God are (as we may so speak) <hi>a visible Word.</hi> The Works of Creation have a Voice in them. The heavens declare the glory of God, day unto day uttereth speech, there is no language <hi>where their Voice is not heard.</hi> Psal. 19. 1, 2, 3. Stars, and Trees, and every Creature in
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:44382:115"/> the higher and in the lower world, preach and proclaim that there is a God, and that He is an infinitely glorious Being. And the Works of Providence have a Voice in them: Yea, common Providences have so; much more, special and signal Dispensations of Providence. Mercyes have a Voice in them; and therefore are said to be <hi>Witnesses.</hi> God hath not left himself without Witness, inasmuch as He giveth Rain from heaven and fruitfull Seasons. Judgements have a Voice in them. <hi>Mic. 6. 9. Hear ye the Rod.</hi> Brutish men may <hi>feel</hi> the Rod; but wise men <hi>hear</hi> the Rod, and understand the Lord's meaning therein. Yea, Judgements from heaven, have a loud, thundring, roaring Voice. <hi>The Lord shall roar out of Sion, and utter his Voice from Jerusalem.</hi> The terrible Judgements, which He doth execute upon the World, are the Lord's Roarings out of Sion. There was <hi>the Voice of Speech;</hi> yea, <hi>the Voice of the Almighty,</hi> in those ludgements, vvhich came upon Jerusalem. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1. 24.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:44382:116"/>
                     <hi>Portentous Signs</hi> in heaven have a speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Voice in them. Sometimes they speak the Mercy of heaven, and good will towards the children of men. As that extraordinary Light which shined about the Shepherds at the Birth of Christ, was a Token of Divine Favour. A very judicious and learned <note n="l" place="bottom">

                  <p>The Lord hath of late Time, been spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king by <hi>very Signal Providences,</hi> in other parts of the World, which we that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>far off, should learn Instruction by. We hear the ratling of the flames of Persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on afar off, whereby the Houses of God in other parts of the World, are burning and consuming.

Had the strength and fury of that Gust fallen upon such a Town as this, where there are a multitude of Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, many Lives had perished.

                     </note>, That <hi>Things, which proceed from Natural causes, if Unusual, are Signal.</hi> So may it be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed as to the Sign now hanging over our heads▪ Oh! let us consider the Lord's Voice therein. But, <hi>What doth the Lord speak unto us by this Latter Sign in Heaven?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Surely the Lord saith by it, The World is full of Unbelief. When the <hi>Jews</hi> continued in their Unbelief, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding <hi>John Baptist</hi>'s powerful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:44382:119"/> it was said, <hi>Except you see Signs and Wonders, you will not believe.</hi> Joh. 4. 48. Truly, except men see Signs and Wonders in heaven, they will not believe. Nay, except they behold a latter as well as a former Sign, they will not believe. How justly may the Lord from Heaven upbraid the World for their Unbelief.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. God seems to intimate that there are great Changes hastning upon the World. When God creates a <hi>New</hi> thing in the Heavens, 'tis a Sign He hath some <hi>Strange</hi> work to do in the Earth. What those Changes are, Time will dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover. Onely (as I have elsewhere no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) the constant Experience of former Ages declares that such Signs <note n="t" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Cometas nova Imperia portendere, apud omnes fere gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes receptum est.</hi> Vulcanius <hi>auruspex, teste</hi> Servio, <hi>ad Eclog. 9. dicebat, Cometa significari Exitum</hi> veteris, <hi>&amp; Ingressum</hi> novi <hi>Seculi.</hi> Grotius <hi>in</hi> Matth. 2. 2.</note> have bin portentous of great Mutations in the World. And the Scripture foretelling the great Changes, and dreadful Revolutions of Providence, which shall come to pass
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:44382:119"/> in the last Ages of the World, saith, that as Forerunners and Intimations thereof, there shall be <hi>Signs in</hi> (or <hi>amongst) the Stars.</hi> God will raise an horrible Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest amongst the Nations, which will make the waves thereof to roar. Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentous and Fearful Sights, are a Sign that the days are at hand, wherein there shall be Distress of Nations, mens hearts failing them for Fear, and for looking after those Things which are coming on the <hi>Earth.</hi> Yea, and that the Powers of <hi>Heaven</hi> shall be shaken. <hi>Luk.</hi> 21. 25, 26.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Voice of the Lord cryeth to us, saying, <hi>Be you prepared for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Changes may come.</hi> Labour to be such as that nothing shall be able to do you any hurt. Be moved with Fear, and get into the Ark. Make sure of an Interest in Christ; and then no wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters can drown you.

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:44382:120"/> set us in. Yea, let them find us watching, and praying <hi>that we may be accounted worthy to escape all those things that shall come to pass, and to stand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Son of man.</hi>
